My Playground

This is my first repository creation and I am a new nebbie here, and a nebbie to android and java.
I want to build apps for android, I've installed Android Studio and worked a few tutorial projects.
I have limited programming experence, but want to learned more espesially OOP. 

At the moment I'm just here to figure this place out.

Cheers,
